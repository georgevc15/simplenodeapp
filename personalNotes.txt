- in test mode we cand start the app like this(before instaling the supertest library): ./bin/www.js instead of node app but we use node test.js
- the libary nedeed for running test is npm supertest -save-dev we use -dev because is not going to be used for production only in development mode

-call mocha
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test.js
or
npm test (but scripts from package.json needs to be modified)

-npm install supertest-g instals a package locally(it makes it available from the command line)
